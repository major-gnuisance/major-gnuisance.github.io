* Uninstallation
  1. Remove the =exec gyro_revolution= line from your =autoexec.cfg= file
  2. 

* Control overview
** Basics
   Use the *right stick* (RS) and the *gyroscope* (controller yaw/pitch
   movement, also referred to as *gyro*) to *move the camera.*

   It's recommended to *rely on the gyro to aim precisely*, relegating
   the right stick for broader motions only, such as turning,
   recentering and coarse target acquisition.

   To readjust your controller stance without moving the camera, hold
   the right stick click (R3). This will temporarily disable the gyro
   input.

   To toggle gyro always-on, press the *SHARE* button. Gyro aiming
   will always be enabled when holding *L2* to aim.\\
   Pressing *R3* will reenable gyro always-on, allowing you to quickly
   restore fine aiming in unexpected confrontations.

   If the camera moves on its own, you need to *recalibrate the
   gyroscope.*\\
   Setting the controller on a flat surface for a while may help, but
   running the calibration procedure in Steam Big Picture Mode's
   settings provides better, long-lasting results.

   Use the *left stick* (LS) to *move*.
   *Tap L3* (left stick click) to *sprint* until you release the stick.

   *Tap X* to *jump.*
   *Circle* to *use.*
   *Tap Triangle* to *toggle crouch.*

   *Hold X* to *crouch after a jump*, which may help extend your reach
   and land tricky jumps. Note: the game itself automatically crouch
   jumps in some situations, usually next to boxes/windows/vents/etc.

   *Press OPTIONS* to *pause.*

** Utility
   Hold down *L2* (left trigger) to zoom in and reduce aiming
   sensitivity. Use it to aim with additional precision.

   *Hold Y* to *toggle the flashlight*.

   *Click and hold* the corresponding touchpad icons to *Quicksave* or
   *Quickload*. \\
   The requirement to hold is so that you don't accidentally save or
   *load your game.

   *Hold R3* to temporarily disable the gyroscope, allowing you to
   reposition the controller without whipping the camera around.

   *Press SHARE* to toggle always-on gyro aiming.\\
   Gyro aiming will still be available when holding the Aim button (L2).\\
   *Press R3* to quickly reenable always-on gyro aiming.

  - Sequential weapon select (D-Pad LEFT/RIGHT)
  - Gyroscope aim
    - Always on by default
    - Can be temporarily stopped by holding R3
      - e.g. hold R3 while readjusting your pose to avoid swinging the
        camera around
    - Gyro can be turned on/off with OPTIONS button
      - Still when holding ADS button (L2)
      - Can be enabled again on a moment's notice by tapping R3
  - Quickload and Quicksave with safety (hold to trigger) on trackpad
  - Menu interaction mode
    - Triggers automatically when the mouse pointer is displayed,
      returns to game mode when the mouse is hidden
    - Trackpad and RS can be used to move the mouse, R3 and Touchpad
      click for Left Mouse Button
  - Squad Command and Pheropods on left edge of trackpad
  - Custom Steam Input Icons for Half-Life 2's Weapons
    - Derived from game assets
  - Lowered rumble intensity (interferes with gyro aim and default is
    generally over the top)

* Experimental features
  - Vehicle controls (touchpad icon)
    - Problems/limitations
      - No way to trigger it automatically without native Steam Input
        support
      - No apparent way to have analog accelerator/brake on triggers
        using Steam Input
      - No apparent way to stop game from reading the raw right stick
        for camera control, so aiming with it is always weird
      - No way to tutorialize an additional control scheme, so it's weird

* Bugs/Problems
  - Potential weapon/mechanic spoilers from on-screen menus and documentation
    - Maybe remove some labels but keep icons?
    - Especially Squad and Pheropod
  - [Linux, maybe others] Game still uses right stick as a source or relative camera
    input when driving vehicles, bypassing Steam Input
    - Need to look into source code to figure out what's going on
  - [Linux, maybe others] Weapon Wheel can be finicky and only
    register inputs when "rolling" the stick, i.e. moving the stick
    straight into a weapon slot is ignored but moving it into an
    adjacent slot and then into the desired slot always works

* Possible Improvements
  - Enhance icon visibility in weapon wheel
  - Blur the background when the weapon wheel is on.
    - =mat_hsv 1= makes it black and white and could be used for a
      similar effect
  - Full gyro off mode
  - Fine tune sensitivities and timings
  - Find way to hide spoilers until needed
    - No way to save state after changing to/from menu mode, though...
    - Proper Steam Input integration or gameside weapon wheel
      implementation would be best, but require mod or update Valve
      - Maybe Half-Life 2: Update would accept to have this?
  - Some features require cheats
    - FoV requires
  - Proper zoom function currently not mapped at all
    - Can't be used for ADS since it prevents firing weapons

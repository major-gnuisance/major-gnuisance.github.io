* Introduction
  This page will help you set up and use a modern control scheme for
  Half-Life 2 with a DualShock 4 controller, via Steam Input.

  The Installation section will show you how to set everything up.
  The Controls section will teach you how to use this control scheme.

* Resource summary
  - Custom cfg file: [[file:gyro_revolution.cfg][=gyro_revolution.cfg=]]
  - Icon pack: [[file:HL2_TouchMenuIcons.zip][=HL2_TouchMenuIcons.zip=]]
  - Controller Configuration
    - v1.0-beta URL: [[steam://controllerconfig/220/2073106958][=steam://controllerconfig/220/2073106958=]]
    - VDF file for manual import: [[file:gyro_revolution_hl2_v1.0-beta.vdf][=gyro_revolution_hl2_v1.0-beta.vdf=]]
  - Changelog: *TODO*

* Installation, summarized
  1. Extract icon pack into game's directory (=Half-Life 2=)
  2. Put =gyro_revolution.cfg= under the =hl2/cfg/= directory
  3. Add line with "=exec gyro_revolution=" to your =autoexec.cfg= file in the same directory (=hl2/cfg=). Create if necessary.
  4. Connect DS4 controller
  5. Enable PlayStation Configuration Support in Big Picture, if not already enabled
  6. Import my configuration

* Installation, detailed
  1. Install icon pack and custom configuration file
     1. Open the game's directory
        - Right click game in Steam library > Manage > Browse local files\\
          [[file:manage_browselocalfiles.png]]
     2. Extract the [[file:HL2_TouchMenuIcons.zip][Icon Pack zip]] there. You should now have a =TouchMenuIcons= directory.
     3. Enter the hl2/cfg/ directory and place the [[file:gyro_revolution.cfg][=gyro_revolution.cfg=]] file there.
     4. (optional) make a backup of your =config.cfg= file should you want to restore it later.
     5. Add =exec gyro_revolution= to your =autoexec.cfg= file
        - If you don't have an =autoexec.cfg= file, use this one: *TODO*
  2. Connect your DualShock 4 to your computer. Either:
     - Wired using a micro USB cable
     - Wireless using Bluetooth
       - With the DualShock 4 turned off, hold SHARE and the PS
         button to enter Bluetooth pairing mode, then pair it with the
         computer.
  3. Enable DualShock 4 configuration support in Steam's Big Picture mode
     1. Start Big Picture by clicking the button to the left of the "minimize" button in Steam\\
        [[file:bpm_button.png]]
     2. Go to Setting > Controller Settings\\
        [[file:bpm_settingicon.png]] [[file:bpm_controllersettings.png]]
     3. Check "PlayStation Configuration Support" box\\
        [[file:bpm_playstationsupport.png]]
     4. Select your controller under "Detected Controllers" and then click *Calibrate*\\
        [[file:bpm_controllerselected.png]]\\
        [[file:bpm_calibratebutton.png]]
     5. Tune your joystick deadzones if necessary\\
        [[file:bpm_joystickdeadzone.png]]
     6. Place the controller on a *stable, level surface* and click "Start Gyro-Only Calibration."\\
        [[file:bpm_startgyrocalibration.png]]
     7. Make sure the controller stays completely still until the calibration is done (about 5 seconds).
  4. Import my configuration
     1. [[steam://controllerconfig/220/2073106958][Click here]] to open the configuration in Steam. It should open this screen:\\
        [[file:bpm_configpreview.png]]
     2. Press Square to apply, then Circle to exit
  5. Play the game!

* Uninstallation
  1. Remove the =exec gyro_revolution= line from your =autoexec.cfg= file
  2. Delete =config.cfg= and possibly restore a backup of it.

* Control overview
** Basics
   Use the *right stick* and the *gyroscope* to *move the camera.*

   It's recommended to rely on the gyro to aim precisely and to use
   the right stick for broader motions only, such as turning,
   recentering and coarse target acquisition.

   The gyro is always-on by default, but you can temporarily toggle it
   off by clicking the right stick (*R3*). This is recommended when driving.

   Hold *L2* to aim more precisely. Gyro is always enabled when doing this.

   If the camera moves on its own, you need to recalibrate the
   gyroscope as explained in the detailed installation instructions.

   Use the *left stick* to *move*.\\
   Click *L3* (left stick click) while moving to *sprint.* You will
   stop sprinting when you return the stick to its neutral position.

   *Tap X* to *jump.*\\
   *Press Circle* to *use.*\\
   *Tap Triangle* to *toggle crouch.*

   *Hold X* to *crouch while jumping*, which may help extend your
   reach, land tricky jumps or vault over obstacles.\\
   Note: the game itself automatically crouch jumps in some
   situations, usually next to boxes/windows/vents/etc. This is only
   useful for more advanced moves.

   *Press OPTIONS* to *pause.*

** Utility
   Hold down *L2* (left trigger) to zoom in and reduce aiming
   sensitivity. Use it to aim with additional precision.

   *Hold Y* to *toggle the flashlight*.

   *Click and hold* the corresponding touchpad icons to *Quicksave* or
   *Quickload*. \\
   The requirement to hold is so that you don't accidentally save or
   *load your game.

   *Hold R3* to temporarily disable the gyroscope, allowing you to
   reposition the controller without whipping the camera around.

   *Press SHARE* to toggle always-on gyro aiming.\\
   Gyro aiming will still be available when holding the Aim button (L2).\\
   *Press R3* to quickly reenable always-on gyro aiming.

    - Optional game slowdown when selecting weapon (requires enabling cheats)
    - Toggle to last weapon by tapping weapon wheel button
  - Quick access to special weapons with D-Pad UP/DOWN
  - (pseudo) Aim Down Sights button (L2)
    - Zooms in and lowers sensitivity for finer aiming
    - Higher magnification requires enabling cheats
    - Doesn't really aim down sights. Get an actual mod for that
  - Modern sprint button (L3)
    - Click once while moving to start sprinting, return stick to center
      position to stop sprinting.
  - Direct access to Crowbar and Gravity Gun (D-Pad UP/DOWN respectively)
  - Sequential weapon select (D-Pad LEFT/RIGHT)
  - Gyroscope aim
    - Always on by default
    - Can be temporarily stopped by holding R3
      - e.g. hold R3 while readjusting your pose to avoid swinging the
        camera around
    - Gyro can be turned on/off with OPTIONS button
      - Still when holding ADS button (L2)
      - Can be enabled again on a moment's notice by tapping R3
  - Quickload and Quicksave with safety (hold to trigger) on trackpad
  - Menu interaction mode
    - Triggers automatically when the mouse pointer is displayed,
      returns to game mode when the mouse is hidden
    - Trackpad and RS can be used to move the mouse, R3 and Touchpad
      click for Left Mouse Button
  - Squad Command and Pheropods on left edge of trackpad
  - Custom Steam Input Icons for Half-Life 2's Weapons
    - Derived from game assets
  - Lowered rumble intensity (interferes with gyro aim and default is
    generally over the top)

* Experimental features
  - Vehicle controls (touchpad icon)
    - Problems/limitations
      - No way to trigger it automatically without native Steam Input
        support
      - No apparent way to have analog accelerator/brake on triggers
        using Steam Input
      - No apparent way to stop game from reading the raw right stick
        for camera control, so aiming with it is always weird
      - No way to tutorialize an additional control scheme, so it's weird

* Bugs/Problems
  - Potential weapon/mechanic spoilers from on-screen menus and documentation
    - Maybe remove some labels but keep icons?
    - Especially Squad and Pheropod
  - [Linux, maybe others] Game still uses right stick as a source or relative camera
    input when driving vehicles, bypassing Steam Input
    - Need to look into source code to figure out what's going on
  - [Linux, maybe others] Weapon Wheel can be finicky and only
    register inputs when "rolling" the stick, i.e. moving the stick
    straight into a weapon slot is ignored but moving it into an
    adjacent slot and then into the desired slot always works

* Possible Improvements
  - Enhance icon visibility in weapon wheel
  - Blur the background when the weapon wheel is on.
    - =mat_hsv 1= makes it black and white and could be used for a
      similar effect
  - Full gyro off mode
  - Fine tune sensitivities and timings
  - Find way to hide spoilers until needed
    - No way to save state after changing to/from menu mode, though...
    - Proper Steam Input integration or gameside weapon wheel
      implementation would be best, but require mod or update Valve
      - Maybe Half-Life 2: Update would accept to have this?
  - Some features require cheats
    - FoV requires
  - Proper zoom function currently not mapped at all
    - Can't be used for ADS since it prevents firing weapons

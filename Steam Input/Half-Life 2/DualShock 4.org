  This page will help you set up and use a modern control scheme for
  Half-Life 2 with a DualShock 4 controller, via Steam Input.

  The Installation section will show you how to set everything up.
  The Controls section will teach you how to use this control scheme.

  1. Extract icon pack into game's directory (=Half-Life 2=)
  2. Put =gyro_revolution.cfg= under the =hl2/cfg/= directory
  3. Add line with "=exec gyro_revolution=" to your =autoexec.cfg= file in the same directory (=hl2/cfg=). Create if necessary.

  5. Enable PlayStation Configuration Support in Big Picture, if not already enabled
  6. Import my configuration

* Installation, detailed
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: installation_detailed
  :END:
  1. Install icon pack and custom configuration file
     1. Open the game's directory
        - Right click game in Steam library > Manage > Browse local files\\
          [[file:manage_browselocalfiles.png]]
     2. Extract the [[file:HL2_TouchMenuIcons.zip][Icon Pack zip]] there. You should now have a =TouchMenuIcons= directory.
     3. Enter the hl2/cfg/ directory and place the [[file:gyro_revolution.cfg][=gyro_revolution.cfg=]] file there.
     4. (optional) make a backup of your =config.cfg= file should you want to restore it later.
     5. Add =exec gyro_revolution= to your =autoexec.cfg= file
        - If you don't have an =autoexec.cfg= file, use this one: *TODO*
  2. Connect your DualShock 4 to your computer. Either:
     - Wired using a micro USB cable
     - Wireless using Bluetooth
       - With the DualShock 4 turned off, hold SHARE and the PS
         button to enter Bluetooth pairing mode, then pair it with the
         computer.
  3. Enable DualShock 4 configuration support in Steam's Big Picture mode
     1. Start Big Picture by clicking the button to the left of the "minimize" button in Steam\\
        [[file:bpm_button.png]]
     2. Go to Setting > Controller Settings\\
        [[file:bpm_settingicon.png]] [[file:bpm_controllersettings.png]]
     3. Check "PlayStation Configuration Support" box\\
        [[file:bpm_playstationsupport.png]]
     4. Select your controller under "Detected Controllers" and then click *Calibrate*\\
        [[file:bpm_controllerselected.png]]\\
        [[file:bpm_calibratebutton.png]]
     5. Tune your joystick deadzones if necessary\\
        [[file:bpm_joystickdeadzone.png]]
     6. Place the controller on a *stable, level surface* and click "Start Gyro-Only Calibration."\\
        [[file:bpm_startgyrocalibration.png]]
     7. Make sure the controller stays completely still until the calibration is done (about 5 seconds).
  4. Import my configuration
     1. [[steam://controllerconfig/220/2073106958][Click here]] to open the configuration in Steam. It should open this screen:\\
        [[file:bpm_configpreview.png]]
     2. Press Square to apply, then Circle to exit
  5. Play the game!

* Removal
  :PROPERTIES:

   Use the *right stick* and the *gyroscope* to *move the camera.*

   It's recommended to rely on the gyro to aim precisely and to use
   the right stick for broader motions only, such as turning,
   recentering and coarse target acquisition.

   The gyro is always-on by default, but you can temporarily toggle it
   off by clicking the right stick (*R3*). This is recommended when driving.

   Hold *L2* to aim more precisely. Gyro is always enabled when doing this.

   If the camera moves on its own, you need to recalibrate the
   gyroscope as explained in the detailed installation instructions.

   Use the *left stick* to *move*.\\
   Click *L3* (left stick click) while moving to *sprint.* You will
   stop sprinting when you return the stick to its neutral position.

   *Tap X* to *jump.*\\
   *Press Circle* to *use.*\\
   *Tap Triangle* to *toggle crouch.*

   *Hold X* to *crouch while jumping*, which may help extend your
   reach, land tricky jumps or vault over obstacles.\\
   Note: the game itself automatically crouch jumps in some
   situations, usually next to boxes/windows/vents/etc. This is only
   useful for more advanced moves.

   *Press OPTIONS* to *pause.*

** Utility
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: utility
   :END:
   Hold down *L2* (left trigger) to zoom in and reduce aiming
   sensitivity. Use it to aim with additional precision.

   *Hold Y* to *toggle the flashlight*.

   *Click and hold* the corresponding touchpad icons to *Quicksave* or
   *Quickload*. \\
   The requirement to hold is so that you don't accidentally save or
   *load your game.

   *Hold R3* to temporarily disable the gyroscope, allowing you to
   reposition the controller without whipping the camera around.

   *Press SHARE* to toggle always-on gyro aiming.\\
   Gyro aiming will still be available when holding the Aim button (L2).\\
   *Press R3* to quickly reenable always-on gyro aiming.

* Bugs/Problems
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: bugs
  :END:
  - Achievements are disabled due to enabling cheats
  - Potential weapon/mechanic spoilers from on-screen menus and documentation
    - Maybe remove some labels but keep icons?
  - L3 doesn't uncrouch automatically.
    - Need to find how directly go into uncrouched state after
      a =toggle_duck=. =-duck= doesn't cut it.

* Possible Improvements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: improvements
  :END:
  - Enhance icon visibility in weapon wheel
  - Blur the background or something when the weapon wheel slowdown is enabled.
    - =mat_hsv 1= makes it black and white and could be used for a
      similar effect, but feels like a bad hack
  - Add animation to zoom and slow motion.
    - Idea: make a dynamic re-aliasing-based binding that
      increments/decrements stuff progressively upon repeated presses
      and couple it with a turbo activator. Could be brittle, though.
  - Full gyro off mode (if anyone asks for it)
  - Fine tune sensitivities and timings
  - Find way to hide spoilers until needed
    - No way to save state after changing to/from menu mode, though...
    - Proper Steam Input integration or gameside weapon wheel
      implementation would be best, but it'd require a mod or an
      update from Valve
      - Maybe Half-Life 2: Update would accept to include such a
        feature?
  - Some features require cheats => find alternatives or make those
    easily optional. An alternate no-cheat cfg file could be easy.
  - Sounds aren't distorted when setting host_timescale for the
    slowdown effect. See if there's any way to do this.
